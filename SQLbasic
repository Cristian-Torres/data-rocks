# SQL Tutorial
SELECT * FROM file.name
SELECT is a keyword used to specify which columns are to be selected
* is used to indicate that all columns are selected
FROM is a keyword used to indicate the source of data
. is used to indicate the relationship between the new_schema and file_title
; is optionally used to end a query script
WHERE is a keyword used to include only certain rows that fulfill the criteria and exclude those that do not
We can use the equal operator (=), greater than (>), less than (<), at least (>=), at most (<=), and not equals to (<>)
LIKE is a keyword used to filter records that contain a series of characters
Sort the results using the ORDER BY, ASC, and DES keywords
GROUP BY are the keywords used to group rows that have the same values together
Single quotation marks (â€˜) are used to enclose a string
AS is a keyword used to rename the resulting column
Use DISTINCT keyword to answer a query when you want to avoid duplicates
You can also limit the number of rows by using the LIMIT clause
The order of GROUP BY, ORDER BY and LIMIT is very important. If you mistakenly change the order, you will have to face errors
The correct order is - GROUP BY -> ORDER BY -> LIMIT. Always remember this
CASE-WHEN allows you to create new variables using infinte conditions

Aggregate functions that can be used to find summary values of the selected rows:
  SUM(col_name) to find the summation of all values in col_name
  MIN(col_name) to find the minimum value of all values in col_name
  MAX(col_name) to find the maximum value of all values in col_name
  COUNT(col_name) to find the number of rows in col_name
  AVG() is a keyword to find the average duration
Note that you use these functions in lower case
HAVING is a keyword used to condition only when you have aggregate functions. It is similar to WHERE clause
